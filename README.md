# Lodash.Stats

The goal is to write a program that connects via the GitHub API to the GitHub - lodash/lodash repository and gathers a couple of statistics.

We would like the program to output statistics on how often each letter is present in the JavaScript/TypeScript files of the repository, in decreasing order.
